# Rahul Dev Garg 👋  
Backend & Platform Engineer | Systems Thinker | Builder

I design and operate **backend and platform systems that hold up under scale, failure, and scrutiny**.  
My work lives at the intersection of **API boundaries, data flow, reliability, and long-term operability**.

I prefer boring systems that behave predictably. Chaos is easy. Engineering is not.

## 👀 Engineering Focus

- Distributed backend systems and platform architecture  
- API and data contract design (REST, GraphQL)  
- Event-driven and asynchronous system design  
- Reliability, failure modes, and operability  
- Internal developer platforms and tooling  
- Modernization of legacy systems without reckless rewrites  

---

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- AI-assisted **system documentation and architecture generation**
- Automated **code → diagrams → printable system docs**
- Event-driven and streaming pipelines under partial failure
- Raspberry Pi–based **edge, networking, and server infrastructure**
- Platform-style deployment models and lightweight orchestration
- Redesigning mission-critical legacy UIs with modern design discipline

### Senior Software Engineer — American Express  
*Apr 2024 – Present*

- Designed and owned a **data publication platform** using Kotlin and BigQuery  
- Defined **contract-driven APIs** (GraphQL + REST) to reduce producer–consumer coupling  
- Applied event-driven patterns to handle bursty workloads and downstream backpressure  
- Built internal service templates and CI/CD automation for standardized deployments  
- Made architectural trade-offs across **cost, latency, security, and operability** in a regulated environment  

---

### Software Engineer — 91Social  
*Aug 2021 – Mar 2024*

- Designed service-oriented backend systems for modular consumer applications  
- Built production mobile apps with clean API boundaries and separation of concerns  
- Developed configurable backend workflows with extensible, event-driven interactions  
- Contributed to **DIGIT DPG**, a government platform supporting rural utilities across states  
- Introduced ownership discipline and backlog hygiene to reduce unresolved work  

---

### Software Engineer — zebo.ai  
*Sep 2019 – Feb 2021*

- Built backend services for digital patient management and scheduling  
- Translated ambiguous product requirements into maintainable backend systems  
- Worked closely with stakeholders to define realistic system boundaries  

---

## 🔬 Independent Systems Work

- Experiment with **container runtimes and lightweight orchestration**
- Explore event-driven and reactive pipelines under load and partial failure
- Work with protocol-level communication (gRPC, WebSockets)
- Maintain architecture notes and system design documents
- Use personal projects as a sandbox for applied distributed systems learning

---

## 🧭 Architecture & Leadership

- Lead system design discussions with focus on boundaries and failure modes  
- Define API standards, versioning strategies, and service ownership models  
- Mentor engineers toward **systems thinking over feature thinking**  

---

## 🎓 Education & Certification

**B.Tech — Computer Science**  
GLA University, Mathura (2021)

**Professional Google Cloud Architect** — Google Cloud  

---

## 💞️ Open to Collaborate On

- Backend-heavy or platform-centric products
- Internal developer tooling and infrastructure platforms
- AI-powered documentation and system visualization
- Legacy system modernization done responsibly
- Open-source projects with real operational constraints

If the system needs to survive real users and real failures, I’m interested.
