# Rahul Dev Garg 👋  
Backend Engineer • Solutions Architect • Builder

I design, build, and fix **systems that are supposed to last**.  
Not demo code. Not hypeware. Real software that survives scale, audits, and humans.

---

## 👀 What I Care About

- **Backend & Platform Engineering**  
  Java, Kotlin, REST, GraphQL, data-heavy systems, service boundaries that make sense.

- **System Architecture & Modernization**  
  Turning legacy spaghetti into boring, maintainable, documented systems.

- **Developer Tooling & Internal Platforms**  
  Frameworks, generators, pipelines, and tools that reduce human error and repeated pain.

- **AI + Documentation + Systems Thinking**  
  Using AI to *explain*, *document*, and *operate* complex systems, not just chat about them.

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning & Exploring

- AI-assisted **system documentation and architecture generation**
- Automated **code → docs → diagrams → printable system manuals**
- Raspberry Pi–based **networking, servers, and edge infrastructure**
- Advanced **CI/CD pipelines**, security scans, and release automation
- Modern UI/UX redesign for **old but mission-critical systems**

Translation: making boring systems elegant again.

## 🧠 Tech Stack (No Aspirational Lies)

**Languages**
- Java, Kotlin, PHP, Dart

**Backend & APIs**
- Spring Boot, REST, GraphQL
- Authentication, authorization, token strategies
- MySQL (yes, actual MySQL), BigQuery

**Frontend / Mobile**
- Flutter (BLoC, modular architecture)
- Bootstrap-based system UIs

**DevOps & Infra**
- GitHub Actions
- Automated deployments, SCA scans
- Linux-based servers and headless setups

**Architecture**
- Service-oriented design
- Configurable systems over hard-coded logic
- Documentation-first thinking

---

## 💞️ Open to Collaborate On

- Backend-heavy products with real users
- Internal tools that teams actually adopt
- Open-source utilities for developers and architects
- AI-powered documentation, system visualization, or infra tooling
- Modernization of legacy systems without rewriting the universe

If the project values **clarity over chaos**, we’ll get along.
