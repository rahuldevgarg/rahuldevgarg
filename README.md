- 👋 Hi, I’m @rahuldevgarg  
- 👀 I’m interested in building **robust backend systems**, **developer platforms**, **AI-assisted system documentation**, and **practical infrastructure** using tools like **Java, Kotlin, PHP, Flutter, BigQuery, GraphQL, REST**, and **cloud-native architectures**. I care about systems that survive scale, audits, and reality.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and experimenting with **AI-driven system design**, **automated documentation pipelines**, **Raspberry Pi–based networking and servers**, **modern UI/UX redesign for legacy systems**, and **advanced DevOps automation**.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **backend-heavy products**, **internal tooling**, **open-source developer utilities**, **AI + documentation workflows**, and **projects that replace fragile legacy setups with sane, modern architecture**.
